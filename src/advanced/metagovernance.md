# Metagovernance of Dilution Bound and Other Metrics
> *researching now*

* should use modeling for this I think...needs more research rather than implementation

* lots of metadata requires for all items, but we need to limit storage overhead so I think that's where clever handling comes into play...

* governing all of these parameters in a consummable way
* explaining every choice and how to make it differently
* we need to audit every mechanism design decision

* Transaction Fees and How They Flow in a Closed System
* Dilution Bound?

* Shawn's article on `Sudo`

## Protocol Engineering vs Mechanism Design (cached here?)

* make a distinction between protocol and application level; maybe describe how Bitcoin works...it is an engineered Cantillon effect; modern block reward proposals have similar intentions, but the real problem with this at the application level is that it hides a tax on user's funds...
* segway into the UTXO example with this...

* maybe make the title more specific...
