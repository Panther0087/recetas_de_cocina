# Balance Transfers

* use `Currency` in lieu of importing `balances`

* bond patterns (from `SunshineDAO`)
* reserve, unreserve, transfer

## Incentive Models in the Context of DAOs

* not everything needs to be incentivizes
* participation in a DAO is incentivizes by the power that it endows the members who control funding decisions
    * **the development of reputation is enough incentive in many cases**

* go over closed system economics

* awareness of bribery / collusive actor dynamics means that you have to think of the scenario in which the processer is the proposal sponsor -- do we want to make this not allowed? or would we prefer to make it so that this isn't advantageous!

## Metagovernance of Dilution Bound and Other Margin Metrics

* governing all of these parameters in a consummable way
* explaining every choice and how to make it differently
* we need to audit every mechanism design decision

* Transaction Fees and How They Flow in a Closed System
* Dilution Bound?
