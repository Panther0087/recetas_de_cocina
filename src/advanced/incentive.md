# Incentive Design

The first rule of incentive design is sometimes just *don't*...Just like in the real world, human coordination does not always require explicit incentive mechanisms guided by fees and reward payouts. In more cases than not, the mutual benefits of an interaction drive coordination; adding an explicit fee structure may be redundant and unnecessary for these cases.

In all honesty, it seems to me that modern human coordination is often still limited by primitive [group thresholds](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html). We still operate through intermediate entities. National and state laws still limit our ability to coordinate on an increasingly global scale. 

By aligning stakeholder incentives through dynamic reward/fee structures, I think blockchain can foster significant innovation as it pertains to humanity's coordination.

## Minimizing Hidden Costs

No, blockchain has not officially solved the tragedy of the commons, but I still maintain an unwavering, naive optimism that, some day, a mechanism built on a blockchain will alleviate some free rider problem. 

Between now and then, I think it's important for us to constantly keep *accessibility* in mind as a design criterion. Above all else, we should reflect on the *hidden costs* of our mechanism and consider how to communicate these costs transparently to all active and potential users.

The most obvious example in [SunshineDAO](https://github.com/AmarRSingh/SunshineDAO) is the share dilution that occurs when *some* proposals are accepted and executed. 

* picture for inflation


* This is the most obvious source of inflation, but if we create an open incentive structure, then we could mint new shares as a reward for DAO actors, but that would also act as a cost to all other members and this complexity is not at all transparent...

## SunshineDAO Closed Incentive Loop

Sustained stakeholder interaction is nontrivial in a digital context (*see [AGP vote turnouts](https://forum.aragon.org/t/evaluating-the-agp-1-voting-results-makes-me-think-we-need-an-aragon-community-token-act/290)*). Although we will not cover voter incentives here, we will introduce a **closed fee structure designed to** 
1. mitigate proposal spam
2. remove stale entries

* trash analogy here...we don't want to issue shares because we want to minimize hidden costs


* use `Currency` in lieu of importing `balances`

* bond patterns (from `SunshineDAO`)
* reserve, unreserve, transfer

## Incentive Models in the Context of DAOs

* not everything needs to be incentivizes
* participation in a DAO is incentivizes by the power that it endows the members who control funding decisions
    * **the development of reputation is enough incentive in many cases**

* go over closed system economics

* awareness of bribery / collusive actor dynamics means that you have to think of the scenario in which the processer is the proposal sponsor -- do we want to make this not allowed? or would we prefer to make it so that this isn't advantageous!

## Metagovernance of Dilution Bound and Other Margin Metrics

* governing all of these parameters in a consummable way
* explaining every choice and how to make it differently
* we need to audit every mechanism design decision

* Transaction Fees and How They Flow in a Closed System
* Dilution Bound?
