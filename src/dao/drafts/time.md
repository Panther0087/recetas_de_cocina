# Time

Parachain slots made me realize that the fee market is not so closely an auction as I assumed, but I remembered Demi's relative slots and I also remembered that Yoshua Wuyts came out with an artcile on `std::Time` so i thought it;d be a good time to re-enter the game...

An `Instant` represents a specific point in time while a `Duration` represents a relative offset.
