# Cookin' with Substrate

This Substrate Cookbook is a collection of simple examples and code patterns that demonstrate good practices when building with [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) and the [Substrate Runtime Module Library](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) (SRML). 

This book does **NOT** cover [installation](https://shawntabrizi.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/#/0/setup), ideation, or details regarding *how* Substrate works. To learn more about Substrate please go to the [official documentation](). 

> mention `SRML` from now on and add links

**It is highly recommended to go through the Substrate [Cryptokitties Collectables](https://shawntabrizi.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/) and [TCR]() tutorials to see these code patterns in action**
