# Getting Started

If you're here, you probably already know about [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) and are ready to start building. If not, I recommend visiting the [official documentation](https://substrate.dev). For a high level overview, read these blog posts:

* [What is Substrate?](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/)
* [Substrate in a nutshell](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/)
* [A brief summary of everything Substrate and Polkadot](https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/)

## How to Use This Book

You can read the book chronologically or jump around. Personally, I prefer jumping around, but people learn in different ways :)

Regardless of the approach you take, it is useful to recognize that [coding is all about abstraction](https://youtu.be/05H4YsyPA-U?t=1789). To accelerate your progress, I recommend skimming the patterns in this book, composing them into interesting projects, and abstracting your own unique recipes. Feel free to reach out for guidance on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate) or in  the [Substrate technical Riot channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org).

## Chef's Choice

My favorite recipes include

* [Mapping](../storage/mapping.md)
* [Structs](../storage/structs.md)
* [Safety First](../advanced/safety.md)
* [Incentive Design](../advanced/incentive.md)
* [Optimization Tricks](../advanced/optimizations.md)
### Notable Substrate Tutorials and Projects
**[Substrate Developer Hub](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub)**

Before anything else, I'd recommend starting with the [Substrate Collectables tutorial](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-collectables-workshop); it'll help you hit the ground running with an interactive sample project.

To learn more about how to build novel blockchains with Substrate, check out the [utxo-workshop](https://github.com/nczhu/utxo-workshop). Preparing for the [Sub0 workshop](https://youtu.be/Q3hjtHaB3rA?t=7) taught me a lot of useful coding patterns in the context of Substrate (which are included in the advanced section e.g. [Incentive Design](../advanced/incentive.md), [Scheduling Collateralization](../advanced/lock.md), [Transaction Ordering](../advanced/ordering.md), and [Robust Conditional Paths](../advanced/conditionals.md)).

If interested in token-based mechanisms, look no further than the [Substrate TCR](https://github.com/parity-samples/substrate-tcr). The [full tutorial](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/building-a-token-curated-registry-dappchain-using-substrate) will teach you Substrate best practices.

If interested in smart contracts on Substrate, check out the [substrate-contracts-workshop](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-contracts-workshop).
