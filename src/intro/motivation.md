# Getting Started

If you're here, you probably already know about [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) and are ready to start building. If not, I recommend visiting the [official documentation](https://substrate.dev). For a high level overview, read these blog posts:

* [What is Substrate?](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/)
* [Substrate in a nutshell](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/)
* [A brief summary of everything Substrate and Polkadot](https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/)

## How to Use This Book

Start by cloning the repo on github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes
```

As you read through the book, practice compiling and testing recipes in [`recipes/kitchen`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/kitchen). You can't learn how to code by reading about it -- play with the code in the kitchen, extract patterns, and apply them to a problem that you want to solve!

You can read the book chronologically or jump around. Personally, I prefer jumping around, but people learn in different ways :)

Regardless of the approach you take, it is useful to recognize that [coding is all about abstraction](https://youtu.be/05H4YsyPA-U?t=1789). To accelerate your progress, I recommend skimming the patterns in this book, composing them into interesting projects, and abstracting your own unique recipes. Feel free to reach out for guidance on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate) or in  the [Substrate Technical Riot channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org).

## Chef's Choice 

My favorite recipes include

* [Simple Token Transfers](../storage/token.md)
* [Nested Structs](../storage/structs.md)
* [Declarative Programming](../safety/cop.md)
* [Optimization Tricks](../advanced/optimizations.md)

### Notable Substrate Tutorials and Projects
**[Substrate Developer Hub](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub)**

Before anything else, I'd recommend starting with the [Substrate Collectables tutorial](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-collectables-workshop); it'll help you hit the ground running with an interactive sample project.

To learn more about how to build novel blockchains with Substrate, check out the [utxo-workshop](https://github.com/nczhu/utxo-workshop).

If interested in token-based mechanisms, look no further than the [Substrate TCR](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-tcr). The [full tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/tcr/) covers Substrate best practices.

If interested in smart contracts on Substrate, check out the [substrate-contracts-workshop](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-contracts-workshop).
