# Protocol Engineering

**needs some work**
Substrate offers increased developer flexibility at every layer of the stack. Rather than making decisions on behalf of developers, Substrate empowers developers to customize protocol layer interactions, thereby providing flexible blockchains suited for their specific application needs. 

At the moment, recipes in this section extract useful patterns from the [utxo-workshop](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/utxo-workshop), but 

**UTXO**
* transaction ordering
* verifying uniqueueness
* managing incentives

**DRAFTS**
* off-chain verification

## Future
* consensus algorithms
* eventually `libp2p` and networking stuff
