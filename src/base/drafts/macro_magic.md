# Key Ingredients

To develop efficiently with Substrate, it is important to be familiar with the basic structure of application development.

## Traits

## Macros

* short definition of a macro; from` `0 to 1`
 
For Substrate development, there are two macros which are very important to understand:

> for each, distill the details from the following links and then use the links as reference

* [construct_runtime](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/construct_runtime)
* [decl_module](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/decl_module)
* impl_stubs
* decl_storage -- to be discussed
* decl_event -- to be discussed
