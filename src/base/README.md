# Substrate Recipes üç¥üòãüç¥

Substrate Recipes is a collection of simple code patterns that demonstrate best practices when building blockchains with **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)**. The repo used to build this book is [open source](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes). Check out the [contributions guidelines](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview of the structure and directions for getting involved.

The current **scope** is limited to module development and runtime configuration. To learn more about Substrate, see the [official documentation](https://substrate.dev).

## What is Substrate?

[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) is a framework for building blockchains. For a high level overview, read the following blog posts:
* [What is Substrate?](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/)
* [Substrate in a nutshell](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/)
* [A brief summary of everything Substrate and Polkadot](https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/)

## How to Use This Book

Start by cloning the repo on github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes
```

As you read through the book, practice compiling and testing recipes in [`recipes/kitchen`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/kitchen). You can't learn to code by reading about it -- play with the code in the kitchen, extract patterns, and apply them to a problem that you want to solve!

It is useful to recognize that [coding is all about abstraction](https://youtu.be/05H4YsyPA-U?t=1789). To accelerate your progress, I recommend skimming the patterns in this book, composing them into interesting projects, and building your own recipes.
