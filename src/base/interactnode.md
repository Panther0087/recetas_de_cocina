# Interact with the Kitchen Node

If you followed [the instructions](./runnode.md) to get your node running, you should see blocks created on the console. You can now use our [Polkadot-JS Apps to interact with your locally running node](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944). You will use the **Chain state** tab to query the blockchain status and **Extrinsics** to send transactions to the blockchain.

To configure relevant type definitions with the UI, follow the directions in the [Collectables tutorial](https://substrate.dev/substrate-collectables-workshop/#/4/rendering-kitties).
