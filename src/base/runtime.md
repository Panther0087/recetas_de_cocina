# Runtime Configuration

The runtime gives context to module development. Indeed, modules are libraries that expose runtime methods to adjust runtime storage. These libraries are configured in the runtime with explicit assignment of the types declared in the module [`Trait`](https://crates.parity.io/srml_example/trait.Trait.html).

*To see how the [srml](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) modules are configured, see the [`node/runtime`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/node/runtime)*
