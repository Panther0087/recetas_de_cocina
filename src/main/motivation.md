# iF YoU'Re ReADInG ThIS It's NOT ToO LaTE

If you're here, you probably already know about [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) and are ready to start building. If not, I suggest checking out the [official documentation](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs). For a high level overview, check out the following blog posts:

* [What is Substrate?](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/)
* [Substrate in a nutshell](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/)
* [A brief summary of everything Substrate and Polkadot](https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/)

I've also written about Substrate on my [personal blog](https://4meta5.github.io/posts/ysubstrate) :)

## How to Use This Book

You can read the book chronologically or jump around. Personally, I prefer jumping around, but people learn in different ways :)

The key thing to keep in mind regardless of the approach you take is that [coding is all about abstraction](https://youtu.be/05H4YsyPA-U?t=1789). To accelerate your progress, I recommend skimming the patterns in this book, composing them into interesting projects, and abstracting your own unique recipes. Feel free to reach out to me at <amar@parity.io> for guidance or, better yet, direct specific questions to the [Substrate technical channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org).

## Chef's Choice

My favorite samples include

* [Mapping](../storage/mapping.md)
* [Structs](../storage/structs.md)
* [Safety First](../advanced/safety.md)
* [Incentive Design](../advanced/incentive.md)
* [Optimization Tricks](../advanced/optimizations.md)

### Tutorial Hall of Fame

Before anything else, I'd recommend starting with [Shawn's Cryptokitties tutorial](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/substrate-collectables-workshop) -- this'll help you hit the ground running with a fun sample project.

If interested in token-based mechanisms on Substrate, look no further than [Gautam's Substrate TCR](https://github.com/parity-samples/substrate-tcr). The [full tutorial](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/building-a-token-curated-registry-dappchain-using-substrate) will teach you Substrate best practices and take your Substrate skills to the next level.

If you want to learn more about how to build unique blockchains with Substrate, check out [Nicole's utxo-workshop](https://github.com/nczhu/utxo-workshop). Preparing for [our workshop at Sub0](https://youtu.be/Q3hjtHaB3rA?t=7) taught me a lot of useful coding patterns in the context of Substrate.
