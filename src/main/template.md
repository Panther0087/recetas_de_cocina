Really consider how to present
* macros
* traits
* common modules
* link to specific functionality (including code patterns)

## Important Macros
> could split into two other files (under the Key Ingredients heading (double nested chapter))

* short definition of a macro; from` `0 to 1`
 
For Substrate development, there are two macros which are very important to understand:

* [construct_runtime](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/construct_runtime)
* [decl_module](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/decl_module)
