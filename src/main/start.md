# Cookin' with Substrate

**This is a work in progress.**

The Substrate Cookbook is a collection of simple examples and code patterns that demonstrate good practices when building with **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** and the **[Substrate Runtime Module Library](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) (SRML)**. 

Both additions (pull requests) and requests (issues) are welcome. If you wish to contribute, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AmarRSingh/SubstrateCookbook).
<!-- TODO: fix `.travis.yml`; add contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` -->
