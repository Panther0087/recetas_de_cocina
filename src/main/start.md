# Cookin' with Substrate

This Substrate Cookbook is a collection of simple examples and code patterns that demonstrate good practices when building with **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** and the **[Substrate Runtime Module Library](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) (SRML)**. 

> *It is highly recommended to follow the Substrate [Cryptokitties Collectables Workshop](https://shawntabrizi.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/) and [TCR tutorial](https://github.com/parity-samples/substrate-tcr) to see these code patterns in action!*

To learn more about Substrate please go to the [official documentation](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/what-is-substrate).

**If you're new to Substrate, it might be worth starting with [Dessert](./old/library) to learn about Substrate in the context of the broader Web3 movement.**
