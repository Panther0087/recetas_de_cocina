# Cookin' with Substrate
The Substrate Cookbook is a collection of simple examples and code patterns that demonstrate good practices when building with **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** and the **[Substrate Runtime Module Library](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) (SRML)**. 

Both additions (pull requests) and requests (issues) are welcome. If you wish to contribute, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AmarRSingh/SubstrateCookbook).
