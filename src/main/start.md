# Cookin' with Substrate üç¥üòãüç¥
The Substrate Cookbook is a collection of simple examples and code patterns that demonstrate good practices when building with **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** and the **[Substrate Runtime Module Library](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) (SRML)**. 

Because this cookbook is still under some construction, it is not yet open for contributions -- but if you have any suggestions or find any mistakes, feel free to reach out to <amar@parity.io>
