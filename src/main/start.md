# Cookin' with Substrate

This Substrate Cookbook is a collection of simple examples and code patterns that demonstrate good practices when building with **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** and the **[Substrate Runtime Module Library](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) (SRML)**. If you're looking for a list of Substrate-related code repos, start with [Dessert](./library.md).

> *It is highly recommended to follow the Substrate [Cryptokitties Collectables Workshop](https://shawntabrizi.github.io/substrate-collectables-workshop/) and [TCR tutorial](https://github.com/parity-samples/substrate-tcr) to see these code patterns in action!*

To learn more about Substrate please go to the [official documentation](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/what-is-substrate).

**If you're new to Substrate, check out the blog posts: [What is Substrate?](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/), [Substrate in a nutshell](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/).**
