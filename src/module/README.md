# Module Menu

The [Substrate Runtime Module Library (SRML)](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml) is a modular and extensible toolkit for building blockchains with Substrate and Polkadot. This section provides examples to leverage and extend the functionalities provided in the SRML.

For ease of mental organization, the Substrate Cookbook presents the SRML in the context of 4 categories:
* **[System](./system/README.md)** - {[`system`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/system), [`support`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/support), [`executive`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/executive), [`indices`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/indices), [`timestamp`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/timestamp)}
* **[Governance](./governance/README.md)** - {[`council`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/council), [`democracy`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/democracy), [`sudo`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/sudo), [`upgrade-key`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/upgrade-key), [`session`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/session)}
* **[Consensus](./consensus/README.md)** - {[`contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/contract), [`consensus`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/consensus), [`aura`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/aura), [`rhododendron`](https://github.com/paritytech/rhododendron), [`grandpa`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/grandpa), [`finality-tracker`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/finality-tracker)}
* **[Economics](./system/README.md)** - {[`assets`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/assets), [`balances`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/balances), [`fees`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/fees), [`staking`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/staking), [`treasury`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/treasury)}

**Note**: Most modules defy this strict taxonomy and cross-category interaction is very common. Likewise, future SRML development is not confined to this categorization!
