* **[`assets`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/assets)** - manages fungible assets
* **[`balances`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/balances)** - handles setting and retrieval of free balance, retrieving total balance, reserved and unreserved balance, repatriating a reserved balance to a beneficiary account that exists, transfering a balance between accounts (when not reserved), slashing an account balance, account removal, rewards, lookup of an index to reclaim an account (when not balance not reserved), increasing total stake.
* **[`fees`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/fees)** - handles all transaction fee related operations
* **[`staking`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/staking)** - periodically determines the best set of validators
* **[`treasury`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/srml/treasury)** - keeps account of the taxed cash and handles its deployment
