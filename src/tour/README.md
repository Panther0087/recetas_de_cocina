# SRML Tour

This section is [srml-tour](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/srml-tour). It intends to explain the features of SRML modules, demonstrate use cases, and explore the code. It is *in progress*, tracked in [issues](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/issues).

<!-- * [Aura](https://crates.parity.io/srml_aura/index.html) - manages offline reporting for Aura consensus
* **[Balances](https://crates.parity.io/srml_balances/index.html)** - handles accounts and balances
* [Consensus](https://crates.parity.io/srml_consensus/index.html) - manages the authority set for the native code
* **[Contracts](https://crates.parity.io/srml_contracts/index.html)** - functionality for the runtime to deploy and execute WebAssembly smart contracts
* [Collective](https://crates.parity.io/srml_collective/index.html) - handles voting and maintenance of council members
* [Elections]():
* **[Democracy](https://crates.parity.io/srml_democracy/index.html)** - handles administration of general stakeholder voting
* [Executive](https://crates.parity.io/srml_executive/index.html) - dispatches incoming extrinsic calls to the respective modules in the runtime
* [Grandpa](https://crates.parity.io/srml_grandpa/index.html) - manages the GRANDPA authority set ready for the native code
* [Indices](https://crates.parity.io/srml_indices/index.html) - an index is a short form of an address; this module handles allocation of indices for a newly created accounts
* [Session](https://crates.parity.io/srml_session/index.html) - allows validators to manage their session keys, provides a function for changing the session length, and handles session rotation
* **[Staking](https://crates.parity.io/srml_staking/index.html)** - manage funds at stake by network maintainers
* [Sudo](https://crates.parity.io/srml_sudo/index.html) - allows a single account to execute dispatchable functions
* [System](https://crates.parity.io/srml_system/index.html) - low-level access to core types and cross-cutting utilities
* [Timestamp](https://crates.parity.io/srml_timestamp/index.html) - get and set the on-chain time
* [Treasury](https://crates.parity.io/srml_treasury/index.html) - keeps account of currency in a `pot` and manages the subsequent deployment of these funds -->
