# Kitchen Sauce

Inspired by the [srml-tour](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/srml-tour), the `sauce` intends to walk through minimal working examples that demonstrate a subset of substrate's logic. Each example in `sauce` draws heavily on existing code and documentation from `palette_support` as well as one or more `frame` modules. *Sources will be linked throughout the walk throughs.*

This section is under construction (and therefore not shown in the `master` build). At the moment, the documentation from [execution schedule](./loop.md) and [treasury](./treasury) do NOT match the logic in the code for `execution-schedule` and `smpl-treasury`. Both require more tests which should lead to changes in the implementations. I would like to benchmark them using `substrate-analytics` to demonstrate this process, but that should come after the documentation.
