# SRML Tour

(*deprecated in favor of structure described in the README; if people voice interest in bringing back srml-tour, I'll spend some time on it*)

[srml-tour](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/srml-tour) intends to explain the features of SRML modules, demonstrate use cases, and explore the code. It is *in progress*, tracked in [issues](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/issues).
