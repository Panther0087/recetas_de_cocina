# Contributing Guidelines
    
* Basic Pattern to Follow:
    * isolate specific pattern
    * show the full file (w/ necessary imports)
    * any necessary imports/inclusions in other files (final version)

* **Contribution (section)**: https://github.com/LayneHaber/contributing-template

## Norms

I try to not use "we" or "our" because I feel like it encourages unncessary language. This isn't a steadfast rule, but I try to follow it.

File issues and I'll help with formatting; if you're already confident, file a PR and I can help clean it up if necessary and add it to the book...

* LINK TO OUTSIDE STUFF A LOT!
    * link to other sections often to illustrate how things work together
    * whenever you reference anything from an external source, link to it
    * **whenever you add a reference to code, link to documentation**
        * (I find it extremely annoying when I read about a macro or trait and have to look it up in the documentation directly)
    
## Rust Culture

don't be a jerk :)
