# Contribution Guidelines
> (1) fix `.travis.yml` (2) clean this tf up

* LINK TO OUTSIDE STUFF A LOT!
    * link to other sections often to illustrate how things work together
    * whenever you reference anything from an external source, link to it
    * **whenever you add a reference to code, link to documentation**
        * (I find it extremely annoying when I read about a macro or trait and have to look it up in the documentation directly)
    
* Basic Pattern to Follow:
    * isolate specific pattern
    * show the full file (w/ necessary imports)
    * any necessary imports/inclusions in other files (final version)
