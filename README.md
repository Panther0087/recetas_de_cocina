_A Hands-On Cookbook for Aspiring Blockchain Chefs_

## Get Started
Ready to roll up your sleeves and cook some blockchain? Read the book online at https:/substrate.dev/recipes

## Repository Structure
There are four primary directories in this repository:

* **Text**: Source of [the book](https://substrate.dev/recipes) written in markdown. This text describes the code in the other three directories.
* **Pallets**: Complete pallets for use in FRAME-based runtimes.
* **Runtimes**: Complete runtimes for use in Substrate nodes.
* **Nodes**: Complete Substrate nodes ready to run.

The book is built with [mdbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) and deployed via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Using Recipes in External Projects

The pallets and runtimes provided here are tested and ready to be used in other Substrate-based blockchains. The big caveat is that you must use the same upstream Substrate version throughout the project. The recipes currently use Substrate@`v2.0.0-alpha.3`. This situation should improve when Substrate begins releasing on crates.io
